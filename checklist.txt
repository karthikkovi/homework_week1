GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
(Instead of the HTML document being structured with semantic elements, there are a number of div elements that have a class name with the appropriate semantic name, these class names consists of: header, footer, main, aside and nav)

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
(Elements do follow a logical structure in the HTML file)

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
(None of the img elements had alt attributes. They have now been added to the file)


WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order


WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
(The title element description has been changed from 'website' to 'Horiseon'. This way, the title is more descriptive. Completed)


One of the img elements has a closing tag, this is now removed

Got rid of the height property of the ".service" selector. The default height looked much better than the original height

"Benefits h2" property has been changed to "Benefits h3" in style.css and in index.html

"Service h3" property has been changed to "Service h2" in style.css and in index.html
